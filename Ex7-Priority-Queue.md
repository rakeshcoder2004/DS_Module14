# Ex 2(b) Priority Queue
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6. End.

## Program:
```

/*
/*#include <stdio.h> 
int size = 0; 
*/ 
void printArray(int array[], int size) 
{ 
int i; 
for(i=0;i<size;i++) 
{ 
printf("%d ",array[i]); 
} 
printf("\n"); 
}
```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
